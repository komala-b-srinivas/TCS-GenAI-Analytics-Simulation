#  Predicting Credit Card Delinquency - TCS GenAI Simulation

This repository showcases my work as part of the **TCS GenAI-Powered Data Analytics Simulation**. I played the role of a data analyst at Tata iQ to help Geldium Finance reduce customer delinquency rates using predictive analytics and AI.

## Project Highlights

- Conducted EDA to identify top risk factors for delinquency
- Built and compared three models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Network
- Justified the use of Decision Trees based on interpretability and business alignment
- Designed a stakeholder-ready AI-powered collections strategy using Agentic AI
- Addressed fairness, compliance, and ethical considerations in financial AI

##  Models Implemented

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | AUC    |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Logistic Regression| 0.49     | 0.12      | 0.43   | 0.49   |
| Neural Network      | ~0.65    | ~0.00     | ~0.00  | ~0.46  |
| **Decision Tree**   | **0.83** | **0.00**  | **0.00**| **0.56** |

 Despite lower precision and recall, **Decision Tree** offered the best accuracy and excellent interpretability, making it ideal for financial compliance and stakeholder trust.
